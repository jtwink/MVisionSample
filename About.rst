Our Innovative Technology
**********************

M-Vision’s technology portfolio is sensor-driven—camera, infrared, lidar, radar, ultrasound, inertial, and GNSS (GPS). Our in-depth understanding of sensor phenomenology allows us to design our sensor subsystem to maximize signal-to-noise ratio. At the backend of our technology are highly sophisticated computer vision, signal processing, and control algorithms. We implement these algorithms in embedded systems and integrate these subsystems to provide cutting-edge solutions to very practical problems in the industries we serve. We have been granted several broad patents for our technology.
